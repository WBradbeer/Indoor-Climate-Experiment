# Indoor-Climate-Experiment
Python Scripts to:
  pull minutely temperature data from Arduino and format in text file (readSerial),
  download regional weather XML files from Environment Canada DataMart (retrieveURL),
  parse hourly temperature data from XML file  to text file (parseData),
  convert text files to csv format (convertToCSV)
  expand hourly temperatur date to minutely without interpolation (expand),
  compare two sets of minutely temperature data visually and statistically (compareCSV),
  
The original intent of this project is to determine the relationship between the outside air temperature 
and the temperature within my room. Using this relationship to estimate the insulation efficiency of my room.
